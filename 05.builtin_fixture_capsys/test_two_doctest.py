# "doctests" and "doctest_namespace" built-in fixture in "pytest"
# "doctests" are tests embedded in the docstrings of your functions, methods,
# or classes.

# Theyâ€™re great for small, simple tests.

# "doctest_namespace" is the fixture, that pytest uses to execute these tests.
# Usually the doctests are added in the "conftest.py" file as fixtures.

# To execute the file with the "doctests",  type in the terminal:
# pytest --doctest-modules <file-name>

# <file-name> is the Python file where the functions with the "doctests" are.
